					The project is the ecommerce website case study of the fictive brand, Bulbi. They sell plants and related products for people who are starting out with gardening while also offer expert advice.

					The website is designed both <strong>for desktop and mobile</strong>. The existing screens go through the users' entire shopping process on both platforms from home screen to confirmation of purchase.

			<div class="section-title">Discovery</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<p>
					Initially I researched what users expect from an ecommerce website, what functionalities must be included, what pain points can’t be ignored. These were further confirmed by <strong>user interviews and testing</strong>. An important example is that the product pages need straightforward descriptions arranged in a bullet point list accompanied by clear, easy to interpret illustrations. Users don’t want to read long paragraphs to find out if a product is what they are looking for.
				</p>
				<p>
					Potential buyers would find the website most likely by searching for a specific product and then landing on a product page. Therefore, they need to include all the information required not just to buy that item but encourage shopping for more.
				</p>		
				<p>
					Through <strong>competitor analysis</strong> I learned the similarities and differences of existing ecommerce platforms that sell plants and related products. All the websites that I analysed featured a type of filtering system for the plants that assists the users at finding the product that matches their circumstances the most.

			<div class="section-text">
				<p>
					I decided on an audience of younger adults who are starting out with gardening but are interested in all sort of products, not just house plants. To match this, I need to include useful expert advice and social media connections.  The personas I created for this are the following

		<section class="card card-sitemap card-colour-2">
			<div class="section-title">Sitemap</div>			
			
			<div class="section-text">
				<p>
					With inspiration from other competitor websites I created the sitemap to define the overall structure of the product. The goal was to aid the users’ shopping experience by making it as intuitive as possible.

					The first user flow I addressed was Emma’s who wants to buy a plant that is non-toxic, in case her cat would decide it’s a good afternoon snack. This process is illustrated below.

					First, I sketched some ideas on paper based on the site map and user flow. With this I explored different ideas and concepts for the website layout. I tested with participants to find out if these met the user needs before moving on to the next step of the design process.

				<p>
					I created multiple iterations of the website, with user testing after each version. This greatly helped me understand more about real life needs of potential buyers and how to arrange information to help a more pleasant experience. After I arrived at an iteration that I was satisfied with I made mobile version as well, keeping all the essential parts intact.

			<div class="section-text">
				<p>
					After having finished the wireframes I moved onto the more detailed prototype. Testing validated some of the decisions while made me alter some features to match user needs better. Due to time constraints I removed a planned page, Plant Care. The purpose of this page was to give expert advice to novice gardeners, however I found that designing this page would be at least as big as the buying process.

			<div class="section-title">1. Homepage</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<p>
					It was essential to keep to homepage tidy and easy to interpret to avoid overwhelming users while also making it visually attractive. To help users easily find the products they need I made a clear navigation bar and a search bar. I also added easy ways to locate items on sale. To connect with the audience there is a social media feed which also helps them get inspiration for their next purchase.

			<div class="section-title">2. Categories</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<p>
					In the categories page I found it was most important to have clear filters, especially as the audience is potentially not very experienced with gardening and not know without help which plants fit their environment. Also with plants it is a real concern that pets or children may get poisoned by eating harmful leaves, so the option to easily filter those is surely beneficial.

				<p>
					Through research I found that often users land on the product page by looking for an item in a search engine. Therefore, this page absolutely must include all the necessary information for purchase such as price of shipping. I also learned with research that users won’t read bloated descriptions for products, which was further confirmed by user testing.

					If the project continues I’d like to do further testing on the existing prototype as there may be usability issues that I am not aware of at the time of writing. Also it would be a great thing to develop a separate user flow for a potential Plan Care section that could give expert advice with training material on gardening.
